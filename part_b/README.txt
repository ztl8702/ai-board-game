Here is the specification for Project Part B, and the current version of the Referee program.

We will discuss both the specification and the referee more in lectures in week 6.

Disclaimer: in order to validate player actions, the referee program stores its own internal representation of the current state of a game. This is separate from the representation each player is expected to store in order to inform its decisions about what action to choose each turn. Please don't look to the referee's internal representation as useful code for you to import or copy into your own implementation, or for good examples of code quality.

The first version of the referee (1.0) was released on 8th April

Shortly afterwards, referee 1.1 was released (version 1.0 was not the right file, oops!).
