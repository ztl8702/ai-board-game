# Project Plan AI

`Therrense Lua (student number: 782578)`  
`Tianlei Zheng (stuednt number: 773109)`

## To Do:
### Together
#### Stage 0
1. Make an online _Watch Your Back_ game UI that multiple human users can play againts each other on

#### Stage 1
2. Write a naive Player class with MiniMax Search, utilising heuristics functions created from Part 1

#### Stage 2
3. Introduce Alpha-Beta Pruning into the search algorithm
4. Maybe Monte Carlo

### Therrense Lua

1. Find and make our own evaluation function by playing against each other
2. Responsible for:
	-   modifying referee to provide more useful information about game being played
	-   improving search strategy optimisation by narrowing search space

3. Adding additional comments in all program files for better readability
4. Finalising and proof reading comments.txt
5. Making sure the files and programs its in the right format
6. Submitting the final assignment and making sure all the files are included
7. Keeping team mates sane and accountable

### Tianlei Zheng

1. Finding and making our own evaluation function by playing against each other 
2. Responsible for:
	-   improving search strategy optimisation in creative ways
	-   designing specialised data structures to reduce space consumption

4. Final code quality check
5. Testing on dimefox 
6. Generating ML learning training data
6. Testing Player class to ML training data
7. Making **sure** our program beats every other program

## How we will be communicating with each other?
1. Weekly meetings (every Thursday 2pm-5pm)
2. Video chat (whenever necessary)
3. FB messenger (twice weekly updates)
