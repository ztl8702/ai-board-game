3. introduce Alpha-Beta Pruning search
4. maybe monte carlo

### Therrense Lua

1. find and make our own evaluation function by playing againts each other
2. responsible for:
	-   modifying referee to provide more useful information about game being played
	-   improving search strategy optimisation by narrowing search space

	-   improving search strategy optimisation in creative ways
	-   designing specialised data structures to reduce space consumption

4. Final Code Quality Check
5. Testing on dimefox 
6. Generating ML learning training data
6. Testing Player class to ML training data
7. Making **sure** our program beats every other program

## How we will be communicating with each other?
1. weekly meeting (every Thursday 2pm-5pm)
2. video chat (whenever necessary)
