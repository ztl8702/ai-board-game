### MAX_DEPTH = 2 > MAX_DEPTH = 3
- proof runs
	- 24 wins vs 13 wins

### MAX_DEPTH = 3 > MAX_DEPTH = 4
- proof runs (QUESTIONABLE RESULT)
	- NEED MORE RUNS
	- 28 wins vs 20 wins
- miniMax (@, MD=3) vs miniMax_copy (O, MD=4)
- python3 referee.py minimax_player_copy minimax_player


### MAX_DEPTH = 4 under 120seconds vs dummy_player
- proof runs
	- 

### MAX_DEPTH = 4 by default and MAX_DEPTH = 6 after double shrink seems good (need to check if its under time constraint)

### only using 1 board coefficient is better
